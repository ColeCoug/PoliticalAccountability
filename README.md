# PoliticalAccountability

This is the repository for a website being deveoloped to hopefully hold representatives accountable. Users will be able to post letters they have sent to their representatives and we will be able to track posts about different issues divided by section, and compare this to the actions taken by representatives that have been made aware of the issues.
